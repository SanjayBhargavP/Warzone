## Problem Statement
Develop a simple "Risk" computer game allowing two or more players to compete in a digital version of the classic board game. The game requires compatibility with the rules and map files for command-line play, as found on the Warzone website.

## Game Objectives
Conquer all territories on the map to win the game.

## Contributions
